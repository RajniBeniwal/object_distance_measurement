# Object Distance Measurement using OpenCV

This project measures the distance of an object from the camera in real time using computer vision techniques with OpenCV.

## 📌 Features
- Real-time camera input
- Object detection using contour detection
- Displays a green bounding box around the detected object
- Calculates and shows approximate distance in centimeters
- Works on a normal laptop webcam

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
Run the Python file:
Copy code
Bash
python object_distance.py
Show an object in front of the camera to see the distance measurement.
📷 Output
Green box appears around the object
Distance is displayed on the screen in cm
